CodeAlpha Task 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📘 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship. The goal is to identify key data patterns and relationships.

📊 Dataset Description
Dataset: Iris (from Seaborn)
Samples: 150
Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
Target: species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
🔍 Steps Performed
Data loading and inspection (head(), info(), describe()).
Missing values check.
Univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots).
Bivariate analysis (scatter plot, pairplot).
Correlation analysis (heatmap).
💡 Key Insights
No missing or invalid data.
Petal length and petal width are highly correlated.
Setosa flowers have distinctly smaller petal measurements.
Petal dimensions are the best indicators of species.
🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

CodeAlpha Task 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📘 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.
The goal is to understand key data patterns, relationships, and insights using Python libraries.

📊 Dataset Description
Dataset: Iris (from Seaborn)
Samples: 150
Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
Target: species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
🔍 Steps Performed
Loaded dataset using Seaborn.
Displayed structure and summary (info(), describe()).
Checked for missing values.
Visualized distributions (histogram, boxplot).
Examined relationships (scatter plot, pairplot).
Analyzed correlations (heatmap).
💡 Key Insights
No missing values — dataset is clean.
Petal length and petal width show strong correlation (r ≈ 0.96).
Setosa species have smaller petals compared to the others.
Petal measurements are more useful than sepal measurements for species classification.
